Simple calender app that can be accessed in your browser. Goal is to build a quick and intuitive way to share events with your friends.

## Build/Run

Setup is currently very simple. Just run `cargo run` in your terminal.

Then access `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your favourite browser.

## Goals

This side project is for to learn how to:

1) create a website using rust,
2) learn how to then host it on a local device and
3) take a look at various cargo crates.

In general, this is for me to practice my rust skills by applying them to a private project.

## Used crates:

- rocket
- chrono
